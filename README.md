# VR Unity Playground

## Features
* A 2-handed shovel which can destroy dirt on contact
* A small-scale grave with diggable dirt, headstone, and footstone
* A brush which can brush away dirt on object
* A test object (an artifact of broken pottery) covered in dirt to be brushed away
* A large collection of diggable dirt blocks in a bowl of unbreakable dirt for stress testing
* Uses the Unity XR tools
  * Uses the Tunneling Vignette to reduce VR sickness during locomotion
* Uses assets from the Unity asset store
  * Includes a nighttime skybox
  * Fog particle generator
 
## First Test Shovel

My first attempt at a shovel. This version was 1-handed and made with 3 primative objects for a mesh. Dirt gets destroyed immediately when colliding with the shovel object. This could easily be improved for use in an actual game but worked as a proof-of-concept xD

## Teleporting to Fling Objects

A fun bug with the Unity XR teleport when letting go of grabbable objects just after teleporting.

## Fun with Mesh Colliders

Mesh colliders with the `Convex` variable enabled on clearly non-convex shapes leads to some *fun* collisions.
